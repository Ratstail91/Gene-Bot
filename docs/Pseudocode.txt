What do I need?

drawing routines (SDL_gfx)

Bots:
	base & modifier stats
	movement systems
	AI systems

Waypoints:
	A way to place them, connect them, and to make  the bots use them

-------------------------

Skills Grid (Genome):

            |Active     |Pasive	    |Modifier
------------------------------------------------
Combat      |Attack     |Defence    |Shape
Reach       |Speed      |Range      |Size
Durability  |Evasion    |Hit Points |Colour


Base Stats:
	Attack - attack value
	Defence - defence value
	Speed - distance it is possible to cover in a single turn
	Range - distance a single attack can be made at
	Evasion - Chance of reducing damage to 0
	Hit Points - physical amount of damage a bot can take before being destroyed

Modifier Stats:
	Shape
	Size
	Durability

Modifier stats are applied as madnitutes of ratios to their respective values, as well as being visual cues to the player. The ratios are something like this:

**TODO

visual cues:

Shapes: circle, triangle, square(baseline), pentagon, hexagon
sizes: 5 sizes, centered around a baseline
color: Red, yellow, white(baseline), green, blue

These can change, but the colours must at least contrast agaisnt the rest of the game. The modifiers don't have specific values assigned to a certain trait; the visual cues only give hints to the player.

Waypoints can become hollow if they can be used.

-------------------------

Combat Damage Equasion:

x = max(0, (A>E) ? A-D+(A*0.6) : A*0.4)

(A) Enemy's Attack
(D) Defence
(E) Evasion
(X) Damage

-------------------------

Breeding:

Two bots must be near each other (within a radius) to breed. Once this option is selected, a bot is created, and placed within a (larger) radius of one of the parents.
